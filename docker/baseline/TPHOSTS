# This file determines the remote systems that your TPMON daemons will
# accept; all others will be rejected.
#
# A single wildcard (*) may be used in the FIRST column only, e.g. you can
# have "*.foobar.edu" to allow all hosts in the domain foobar.edu access
# to the TPMON daemons.
#
# Note that TPMON1 handles requests for remote FITS disk access; see the
# help file for MOUNT for additional details.
#
# Default as-shipped configuration has "localhost" to disable any remote
# access completely.
