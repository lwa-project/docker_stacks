# PRDEVS.LIST -- List of AIPS Printers for your site
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Place a one-line entry for each printer that you wish to make
# available to AIPS users.  The first column should have the printer
# name as known to /etc/printcap or equivalent.  The second is the AIPS
# printer type, one of PS, PS-CMYK, QMS, TEXT, or PREVIEW for PostScript
# (tm), Color PostScript, QUIC (QMS or Talaris), plain text, or screen
# previewers respectively.
#
# Column three specifies a comma-separated (NO SPACES!) list of options
# for each printer.  RIght now there are four possible values: NONE,
# DUP to indicate a duplex printer, DEF to indicate a default printer,
# and BIG[=VALUE] to indicate that this is _the_ "big" printer and any
# print job with more lines than VALUE (default 1000) will be diverted
# there regardless of what printer the user chose.
#
# This version for NRAO-Charlottesville.
